      <h3>Got Sacks?</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Three brothers live on a farm. They agreed to buy new seeds for the coming season. John and Willian went
      to buy the new seeds and Charles stayed to protect the fields. John bought seventy-five sacks of barley and William
      bought forty-five sacks. The two men proceed to head home with their new supply. Once they arrive, they decide to split the sacks equally among them.
      Charles paid $1400 for the barley and John received $175.

    <p><b>How much money did William get of the sum, considering equal split of the sacks?</b><p>
